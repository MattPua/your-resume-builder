# shadcn instructions

Use the latest version of Shadcn to install new components, like this command to add a button component:

```bash
bunx shadcn@latest add button
```

# Component size limit

No component should be more than 300 lines long if possible. If a component exceeds this limit, it must be refactored and split into smaller, more focused components.
